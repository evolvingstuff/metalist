"""The time split and the tagging moments every model is scored on.

World: the notes as they were at the cutoff. Every note created at or after the
cutoff keeps its text and place in the tree but loses its explicit non-meta tags,
so no model learns from tags the user had not written yet. (Tag addition dates
are not stored: tags on older notes are their current tags.)

Test notes: tagged notes created inside the test window, ordered by creation.
Each gives one case per moment and stage:
  - stage i: the first i of its tags (in the order written) are in the bar;
  - empty bar: every remaining tag is a target;
  - first letter: the next tag is the target, with its first character typed.
