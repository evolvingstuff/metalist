# Tag Suggestions: What the Offline Experiment Taught Us

In October 2026 we compared the tag-bar ranking with learned and rule-based
alternatives on a real namespace (about 107,000 notes, 67,000 tagged, 10,400
distinct tags, 8,000 rules). The experiment lives in
`experiments/tag_suggestions/` (see its README); it prints totals only. This
note records what we learned and the improvements left for later. The first
one, the one-letter fix, is already in (`docs/ui/tag-bar.md`).

## How we measured

- Time split: learn from older notes, test on tagged notes created in the
  latest 20%; every tag written after the cutoff is hidden from every model,
  including today's ranking.
- Moments: an empty tag bar, and the first letter of the next tag typed, each
  with 0, 1 or 2+ of the note's tags already in the bar (in the order written).
  Targets are tags not already applying through the bar, inheritance or rules.
- Main score: whether a correct tag is in the top 5 ("hit@5"); also the rank of
  the first correct tag and whether the first suggestion is right.

## Results (latest 20%, 500 test notes)

Hit@5, empty bar with no tags yet / all empty-bar moments / first letter:

| Ranking | No tags | Empty bar, all | First letter |
|---|---|---|---|
| Before (MetaList, Oct 2026) | 78.0% | 74.3% | 25.4% |
| Same, keeping the empty-bar order after one letter | 78.0% | 74.3% | 79.2% |
| Fixed formula (no training) | 84.1% | 79.9% | 82.6% |
| Gradient-boosted trees (LightGBM) | 85.8% | 81.7% | 83.3% |

- Candidate ceiling: a correct tag was among the candidates the learned rankers
  could choose from in 86.6% of moments, so the trees are near what those
  candidate sources allow.
- Time per request on that namespace: today's ranking about 200 ms; the
  experiment's candidates and inputs (including similar notes) about 4–5 ms.
- What the trees relied on: tag name appearing in the note's text (about 41%
  of gain), similar notes by text (about 34%), word statistics (about 10%);
  recency, usage, co-occurrence each a few percent. Hierarchy signals
  (siblings, parent, depth) barely mattered on this namespace.
- Merging today's list into the trees' list added nothing: today's ranking
  knows nothing the trees miss once they have name-in-text candidates.
- Today's ranking is still slightly better on rare tags (used 1–3 times: 64%
  vs 55–59%) and on never-used tags named in the text (28% vs 25–27%); the new
  methods are far better on common tags (58% vs 67–73%).

## Done

- One letter typed keeps the empty-bar order, with tags that already apply
  right after the evidence-based matches. Confirmed on the namespace with the
  shipped code: first-letter hit@5 25.4% → 79.4%, first suggestion right
  12.1% → 63.1%, correct tag anywhere in the 20 shown 43.0% → 85.1%; empty-bar
  results unchanged. Time per request in that run: median 262 ms after one
  letter vs 234 ms for an empty bar (slowest 5%: about 850 ms for both). The
  earlier one-letter time was not measured separately, and run-to-run machine
  load varied too much to compare across runs.

## Possible future improvements

In rough order of value for effort:

1. **A similar-notes signal in the existing ranking.** The strongest missing
   signal. A word index over notes (much like the search index, in plain
   Python, updated on save) giving "tags of the most similar notes". Needs a
   speed and memory measurement on a 100,000-note namespace before committing.
2. **The fixed formula** as the tag-bar ranking: similar-notes vote + 0.5 ×
   tag name in the text + 0.25 × share of notes with all the bar's tags that
   also carry the candidate (weights chosen by grid search on this namespace;
   recency and usage got zero). About 80% of the trees' gain with no training
   and no new dependencies, and about 40× faster than today's ranking. Before
   adopting: add word statistics (Naive Bayes counts) as a signal, use a finer
   grid, check the earlier time window, and check the first suggestion, where
   the formula is no better than today (62% vs 61%; trees 68%).
3. **Faster suggestions regardless of method.** A median of about 250 ms and
   a slowest 5% of about 850 ms per request is noticeable; profile today's
   ranking on a large namespace.
4. **Rare and never-used tags.** Keep today's literal content matching (it
   wins there) as one candidate source for whatever replaces it.
5. **Learned trees** only if the formula falls short. Costs found: about a
   minute of training after unlock at this size (mostly computing training
   inputs), retraining in the background, and shipping LightGBM/numpy/scipy/
   scikit-learn on every platform (LightGBM needs OpenMP installed separately
   on macOS).
6. **Feedback logging**: suggestions shown, picked, skipped,
   and tags typed in full without being offered. Would let weights adapt to
   actual use; needs a schema change and a privacy decision.
7. **More moments in the experiment:** two- and three-letter prefixes, and
   tags that already apply (6.5% of moments were skipped because the tag
   written already applied through inheritance or rules).

## Caveats

- One namespace, one time window measured in detail (the 60–80% window was not
  completed); results may differ for other people's tagging habits.
- Tag addition dates are not stored, so notes created before the cutoff keep
  their current tags in the experiment.
- Each comparison rests on a few hundred moments; differences of about 5 points
  or more are unlikely to be noise, smaller ones may be.
