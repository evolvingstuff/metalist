# Login screen

The login and loading screens are one dark screen with the MetaList logo (the
teaser's block **M** over two bars, static). The logo sits at a fixed distance
from the top and never moves; everything else happens in the panel under it.

## Panel under the logo
- At first only the logo shows. Once the namespace list has loaded, the panel
  fades in as a whole (about 250 ms): the namespace dropdown (when there is more
  than one namespace), the password field, then **OK**, 10 px apart and 72 px below
  the logo. If the list fails to load, the panel appears anyway with the error.
- The panel is transparent rather than hidden while it waits, so a browser can
  fill a saved password before it fades in; a filled field keeps the dark look
  (no yellow or blue autofill background).

## Logging in
| Moment | Screen |
|---|---|
| Press OK (or Enter) | Nothing moves. The button reads "Checking…" and is disabled |
| An upgrade is due (`/auth/status` `database_upgrade_pending`) | While checking, a grey italic note under OK: "Backing up and upgrading this namespace…" |
| Wrong password, too many attempts, or the request fails | The reason appears under OK; the field is emptied and focused. Nothing moved |
| Password accepted | The form slides out to the left while the loading view slides in from the right (350 ms, within the logo's width) |
| Loading | A progress bar the logo's width that never moves backwards; under it, in grey italics, the current step and the seconds elapsed ("Decrypting notes into memory… · 4s") |
| Loading done | The app appears |
| Loading fails | The error replaces the step line in red, with the elapsed time frozen; the app does not open |

With the system's reduce-motion setting the fades and the slide become instant.

## No white page in between
A password namespace's page opens straight on the login screen when a login is
certain: the browser has no session cookie (first visit, after logging out) or
the URL asks for one (`force_reauth=1`). A reload with a session cookie waits
for the session check instead, so a logged-in reload goes straight to the app
(`app/presentation/login_page.py`).

## Session locked
`/locked` uses the same look: the logo, "Session locked" and one button (Go to
Login, or Take Over Session for a namespace without a password). The button
fades the heading and button out (200 ms) before opening the login page, where
the panel then fades in under the same logo.

## Code
- Markup: `app/templates/index.html`, `app/templates/locked.html`, shared logo
  `app/templates/_logo_mark.html`.
- Behaviour: `app/static/js/modules/auth.js` (form, busy state, slide, progress,
  elapsed time), `app/static/js/locked.js`.
- Styles: the login section at the top of `app/static/css/main.css`.
