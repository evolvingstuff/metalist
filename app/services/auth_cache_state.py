"""In-memory flag tracking whether the cache was hydrated post-login.

This lets the /auth/login endpoint avoid re-reading sqlite every time a user
logs in. The app starts with the flag cleared. Once the cache has been
refreshed using a real DEK, we mark it so future logins can skip the expensive
populate step. If we ever need to force a refresh (password reset, etc.), call
``reset_cache_state``.
