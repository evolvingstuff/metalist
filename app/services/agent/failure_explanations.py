"""Plain-language explanations of failed structured AI steps.

When the model's reply to a structured step (summary batches, tag batches…)
is rejected on every attempt, the chat shows this explanation instead of a
bare "open Agent Debug": which step failed, what went wrong on each attempt,
the setup, and what the user can try. It is stored with the turn, so it stays
readable later without the debug trace.
